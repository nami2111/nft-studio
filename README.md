## Architecture

NFT Studio follows a sophisticated, performance-first architecture built on modern web technologies and Single Responsibility Principle (SRP) with Svelte 5 patterns:

### Core Architecture Layers

1. **UI Layer** (`src/lib/components/`): Svelte 5 components with runes-based reactivity
2. **Domain Layer** (`src/lib/domain/`): Business logic, validation, and worker orchestration
3. **Store Layer** (`src/lib/stores/`): Modular state management with auto-persistence
4. **Worker Layer** (`src/lib/workers/`): Advanced worker pool with dynamic scaling
5. **Persistence Layer** (`src/lib/persistence/`): Multi-backend storage abstraction
6. **Utils Layer** (`src/lib/utils/`): Performance monitoring and error handling

### Modern State Management with Svelte 5 Runes

The state management system leverages Svelte 5's advanced runes with intelligent auto-persistence:

- **`stores/project.store.svelte.ts`**: Core project state with 500ms debounced persistence
- **`stores/gallery.store.svelte.ts`**: IndexedDB-based collection management with filtering
- **`stores/resource-manager.ts`**: Three-tier caching with automatic ObjectURL cleanup
- **`stores/file-operations.ts`**: ZIP import/export with progress tracking
- **`stores/loading-state.ts`**: Centralized loading states and performance metrics

### Advanced Worker Pool Architecture

**Dynamic scaling with device capability detection and health monitoring**:

- **Task Complexity Classification**: LOW to VERY_HIGH based on collection size and layer complexity
- **Device-Aware Scaling**: 75% CPU core utilization, 128MB memory per worker, mobile optimization
- **Work-Stealing Algorithm**: Performance-weighted task distribution across workers
- **Health Monitoring**: Ping-based checks with automatic restart and configurable limits
- **Streaming vs Chunked**: Adaptive generation strategy based on collection size and device capabilities

### Performance-First Features

#### Three-Tier Caching System
- **ImageBitmap Cache**: 100MB, 500 entries, 30min TTL for fast rendering
- **ImageData Cache**: 50MB, 200 entries, 15min TTL for manipulation operations
- **ArrayBuffer Cache**: 200MB, 1,000 entries, 1hr TTL for worker transfers

#### Intelligent Memory Management
- **Adaptive Chunking**: Dynamic sizing based on runtime memory monitoring
- **LRU Eviction**: Least recently used items purged first
- **Transferable Objects**: Zero-copy ArrayBuffer transfers for maximum performance
- **Resource Cleanup**: Automatic ObjectURL tracking and cleanup

#### Domain-Driven Design
- **Zod Validation System**: Runtime type safety with branded types and error context
- **Factory Pattern**: Consistent entity creation with validation and error handling
- **Multi-Schema Validation**: Separate schemas for import/export vs runtime operations
- **String Sanitization**: Injection prevention with comprehensive input validation

### Component Architecture

#### Reactivity and Performance
- **Svelte 5 Runes**: `$state`, `$derived`, `$effect` for fine-grained reactivity
- **Batch Processing**: 100ms debounced trait updates for improved performance
- **Virtual Scrolling**: Efficient rendering of large NFT collections
- **Progressive Loading**: Real-time preview updates during generation

#### Modular Component System
- **Layer Management**: Drag & drop, bulk operations, trait filtering with performance optimization
- **Preview System**: Canvas rendering with debounced updates and adjacent trait preloading
- **Gallery Interface**: Virtual scrolling, interactive filtering, responsive layouts
- **UI Components**: Comprehensive library with accessibility and mobile support

### Type Safety and Validation

#### Comprehensive TypeScript Coverage
- **Branded Types**: Compile-time safety for IDs (ProjectId, LayerId, TraitId)
- **Strict Configuration**: Full type coverage across the codebase
- **Zod Schemas**: Runtime validation with detailed error context
- **Error Hierarchy**: Typed errors with recoverable vs non-recoverable flags

### Design Principles

- **Performance First**: Web Workers, intelligent caching, and memory optimization
- **Single Responsibility**: Each module has one clear purpose with clean interfaces
- **Separation of Concerns**: UI, business logic, and persistence are cleanly separated
- **Modern Patterns**: Leverages Svelte 5 features and latest web APIs
- **Developer Experience**: Comprehensive tooling, testing, and documentation
- **Error Resilience**: Graceful degradation with automatic recovery mechanisms

## Application Structure

## Common Development Tasks

### Adding a New Feature

1. Define types in `src/lib/types/`
2. Add validation schemas in `src/lib/domain/validation.ts`
3. Implement business logic in `src/lib/domain/`
4. Update the project store in `src/lib/stores/project.store.svelte.ts`
5. Create UI components in `src/lib/components/`
6. Add error handling with typed errors

### Working with Web Workers

- Message types defined in `src/lib/types/worker-messages.ts`
- Worker client: `src/lib/workers/generation.worker.client.ts`
- Worker implementation: `src/lib/workers/generation.worker.ts`
- Worker pool for parallel processing: `src/lib/workers/worker.pool.ts`

### Testing

- Unit tests for validation: `src/lib/domain/validation.test.ts`
- Worker pool tests: `src/lib/workers/worker.pool.test.ts`
- Run tests with `pnpm test`, `pnpm test:watch`, or `pnpm test:coverage`

## Environment Variables

- `VITE_APP_SATELLITE_ID` - Juno deployment ID (optional, for ICP blockchain integration)

## File Naming Conventions

- `.svelte.ts` for stores using Svelte 5 runes
- `.test.ts` for test files
- Kebab-case for components, camelCase for utilities
- PascalCase for interfaces, camelCase for implementations
- Branded types use PascalCase with descriptive suffixes (e.g., `ProjectId`, `LayerId`)

## Code Style

- **Indentation**: Tabs
- **Strings**: Single quotes
- **Semicolons**: Always used
- **Line Width**: 100 characters
- **Equality**: Strict operators (`===`, `!==`)
