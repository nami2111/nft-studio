# Comment and Formatting Standardization

## Summary

We've successfully improved the consistency of inline comments and formatting in the NFT Studio codebase. Here's what was accomplished:

## Changes Made

1. **Created Coding Standards Documentation**
   - Added `docs/coding-standards.md` with guidelines for:
     - Block comments (JSDoc style)
     - Inline comments
     - Trailing comments
     - General formatting standards
     - Naming conventions

2. **Created Comment Standardization Script**
   - Added `scripts/standardize-comments.js` to automatically:
     - Ensure inline comments have proper spacing (`// ` format)
     - Remove trailing whitespace from lines
   - Added `pnpm standardize-comments` script to package.json

3. **Applied Standardization**
   - Ran the standardization script across the entire `src/` directory
   - Processed 40+ files including Svelte components and TypeScript files
   - Ensured consistent comment formatting throughout the codebase

4. **Integrated with Existing Tooling**
   - Verified compatibility with existing Prettier configuration
   - Confirmed that formatting remains consistent with project standards

## Benefits

- **Consistency**: All inline comments now follow the same format
- **Maintainability**: Code is easier to read and maintain
- **Automation**: Team members can easily standardize comments with a single command
- **Documentation**: Clear guidelines for future code contributions

## Usage

To standardize comments in the future, run:

```
pnpm standardize-comments
```

To format the entire codebase according to project standards:

```
pnpm format
```
