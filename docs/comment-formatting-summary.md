# Comment and Formatting Standardization

## Summary

We've successfully improved the consistency of inline comments and formatting in the NFT Studio codebase. Here's what was accomplished:

## Changes Made

1. **Enhanced Coding Standards Documentation**
   - Updated `docs/coding-standards.md` with comprehensive guidelines for:
     - Block comments (JSDoc style) with examples
     - Inline comments with best practices
     - Trailing comments usage
     - General formatting standards
     - Naming conventions
     - Error handling patterns
     - Testing guidelines

2. **Maintained Comment Standardization Script**
   - Kept `scripts/standardize-comments.js` to automatically:
     - Ensure inline comments have proper spacing (`// ` format)
     - Remove trailing whitespace from lines
   - Retained `pnpm standardize-comments` script in package.json

3. **Applied Standardization**
   - Ran the standardization script across the entire `src/` directory
   - Processed all files including Svelte components and TypeScript files
   - Ensured consistent comment formatting throughout the codebase

4. **Integrated with Existing Tooling**
   - Verified compatibility with existing Prettier configuration
   - Confirmed that formatting remains consistent with project standards
   - Added proper TypeScript typing for better code quality

## Benefits

- **Consistency**: All inline comments now follow the same format
- **Maintainability**: Code is easier to read and maintain
- **Automation**: Team members can easily standardize comments with a single command
- **Documentation**: Clear guidelines for future code contributions
- **Quality**: Enhanced error handling and testing standards improve code reliability

## Usage

To standardize comments in the future, run:

```
pnpm standardize-comments
```

To format the entire codebase according to project standards:

```
pnpm format
```

To check for formatting issues without making changes:

```
pnpm lint
```

To run all code quality checks:

```
pnpm check
```

## Best Practices

1. **Run standardization before committing**:

   ```bash
   pnpm standardize-comments && pnpm format
   ```

2. **Check code quality regularly**:

   ```bash
   pnpm check && pnpm lint
   ```

3. **Follow the coding standards**:
   - Reference `docs/coding-standards.md` for detailed guidelines
   - Use JSDoc for all public functions and interfaces
   - Write descriptive commit messages
   - Keep functions small and focused
