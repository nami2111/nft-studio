# NFT Studio

## Project Brief

This project is an **NFT Studio** application built using **SvelteKit**. It's designed as a web-based tool for creating, managing, and interacting with NFTs (Non-Fungible Tokens). The application leverages **TypeScript** for type safety and modern JavaScript features. It integrates with **Juno** (likely for decentralized backend services) and uses **Tailwind CSS** for styling, along with utilities like `clsx` and `tailwind-merge` for dynamic class handling.

## Goals

User have a web app that help them generate NFT Collection by uploads traits/layers. Setup Project information, and all what they need, then generate and download the ZIP file with their collection image and metadata inside.
