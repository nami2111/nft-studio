# Product Requirements Document: NFT Generative Collection Studio

Version: 1.0  
Date: August 6, 2025  
Status: Draft  
Author: Gemini & User

## 1. Introduction & Product Vision

NFT Generative Collection Studio is a web-based application designed to empower NFT artists and creators by providing an intuitive, powerful, and user-controlled toolset to design, configure, and generate generative art collections.

The core vision is to democratize the creation of NFT collections, removing complex technical barriers and giving creators full artistic freedom to produce high-quality digital assets (images and metadata) offline before they are uploaded and minted to a blockchain.

## 2. Target Audience

This document identifies two primary user personas:

- **Artists & Digital Creators**: Individuals or small teams who own visual assets (layers/traits) but lack the technical expertise or time to write custom scripts to generate their collections. They require an easy-to-use visual interface.
- **Developers & NFT Agencies**: More technical users who need a rapid tool for prototyping and generating collections for clients. They value advanced features like the Rules Engine and workflow efficiency.

## 3. Features & Functionality (User Stories)

### 3.1. Project & Collection Management

- As a user, I want to be able to create a new collection project by providing a name, a description, and setting the output image dimensions (e.g., 1000x1000 pixels).
- As a user, I want to be able to save my work in progress and open it again later.

### 3.2. Layer Management

- As a user, I want to be able to create layer categories (e.g., Background, Body, Head).
- As a user, I want to be able to upload .png image files (with transparency) into each layer category.
- As a user, I want to be able to set the layer stacking order via a drag-and-drop mechanism to ensure images are rendered correctly.

### 3.3. Rarity Configuration

- As a user, I want every uploaded image trait to automatically receive a default rarity weight (value: 5).
- As a user, I want to be able to change the rarity weight of each trait on a scale from 1 (rarest) to 5 (most common) to control its appearance probability.

### 3.4. Rules Engine — [v1.0 Feature]

- As a user, I want to be able to create Inclusion rules (If Layer A–Trait X appears, then Layer B–Trait Y must appear).
- As a user, I want to be able to create Exclusion rules (If Layer A–Trait X appears, then Layer B–Trait Y must not appear).
- As a user, I want to be able to mark a layer as "Optional" (or "Can be empty"), meaning not every NFT in the collection must have that layer.

### 3.5. Generation Engine

- As a user, I want to be able to input the total number of NFTs I wish to generate.
- As a user, I want the generation process to run in the background (using Web Workers) so the application interface does not freeze.
- As a user, I want to see a clear progress bar and status text (e.g., "Processing 500/1000...") during the generation process.
- As a user, I want to be able to cancel an ongoing generation process.
- As a user, I want the application to process the generation in batches to prevent the browser from crashing when handling large collections.

### 3.6. Output & Export

- As a user, I want each generated image to be a composite of layers assembled according to the specified order and rules.
- As a user, I want each image to have a corresponding .json metadata file that adheres to the OpenSea standard.
- As a user, I want to be able to download the entire collection (images and metadata) as a single .zip file, neatly structured into `/images` and `/json` folders.

## 4. User Flow

1. Initiation: The user opens the application and selects "Create New Collection".
2. Setup: The user names the collection, sets image dimensions, and creates the initial layer structure.
3. Asset Upload: The user uploads their .png files into the appropriate layers.
4. Configuration: The user sets the layer order and adjusts the rarity weights for each asset.
5. Generation: The user opens the generator panel, inputs the desired quantity, and starts the process.
6. Monitoring: The user monitors the progress bar and waits for the process to complete.
7. Export: Upon completion, a download link for the .zip file appears automatically. The user downloads the final assets to their local machine.

## 5. Technical & Architectural Requirements

- **Platform**: Web-Based Application (Browser-Based).
- **Language**: TypeScript.
- **Frontend Framework**: SvelteKit or React (Next.js).
- **Deployment Target**:
  - Primary: Internet Computer (ICP) via Juno.build for full decentralization.
  - Secondary/Fallback: Traditional cloud platforms like Vercel or Netlify.
- **Core Architecture**:
  - Client-Side Logic: The entire core process (image composition, rule validation, metadata creation) is executed in the user's browser.
  - Multithreading: Must use Web Workers to offload heavy processing from the main UI thread.
  - Memory Management: Must implement Batch Processing to handle large-scale collections efficiently.
  - Packaging: Use a library like JSZip or an equivalent to create the .zip file on the client side.

## 6. Non-Functional Requirements

- **Performance**: The application must remain responsive even while generating thousands of items. The time to start the generation process after a click should be under 2 seconds.
- **Usability**: The interface must be clean, intuitive, and require no technical manual for a non-technical user to operate.
- **Compatibility**: The application must function correctly on the latest versions of modern desktop browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Edge) on Windows and macOS.
- **Security & Privacy**: The user's raw assets (.png files) must not be uploaded to any server and must remain on the user's machine throughout the process.

## 7. Future Scope (V2 and Beyond)

- Preview Feature: The ability to manually select traits from each layer to instantly preview a combination.
- Collection Analytics: Display rarity distribution statistics of the generated set before download.
- IPFS Integration: An option to directly upload images and metadata to an IPFS service (like Pinata) and automatically update the .json files.
- Animation Support: The ability to generate GIFs or short videos from animated layers.

## 8. Success Metrics

- **Adoption Rate**: Number of unique projects created per week/month.
- **Completion Rate**: Percentage of users who successfully generate and download a collection after starting a project.
- **Average Collection Size**: The average number of items generated per project, indicating user trust in the application's capability.
- **User Feedback**: Positive reviews and feature requests that show community engagement.
