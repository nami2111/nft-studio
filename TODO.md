## Improvements backlog (Auto-driven plan)

- [x] Architecture refactor: split project store into domain, persistence, and UI layers.
  - Rationale: reduces coupling, easier testing, easier to maintain.
  - Steps:
    - [x] Create src/lib/persistence/storage.ts with a generic PersistentStore interface and adapters for localStorage and IndexedDB.
    - [x] Move localStorage usage in src/lib/stores/project.store.ts to persistence.ts.
    - [x] Create src/lib/domain/models.ts to centralize interfaces (Project, Layer, Trait). Update imports across codebase.
    - [x] Break large project.store.ts into modules:
      - [x] persistence.ts for persistence helpers
      - [x] domain.ts for domain logic
      - [x] store-core.ts for the Svelte store glue
- [x] Remove merge-conflict residues and duplicate comments in project.store.ts and other modules (cleanup).
- [ ] Testing: Add unit tests for project.store.ts using Vitest.
- [ ] CI/CD: Add test gates and static analysis in GitHub workflows.
- [ ] Documentation upgrades: architecture diagrams, onboarding guide, and in-code docs.
- [x] Dependency hygiene: ensure environment parity and lockfile integrity.
- [x] Coding standards: enforce consistency across codebase.
- [x] Security hardening: review for potential vectors.
- [x] Data import/export hardening: strengthen validation.
- [ ] Performance instrumentation: measure and optimize runtime.
