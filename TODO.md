# NFT Studio Codebase Improvement Suggestions

## 1. Testing

[DONE] Unit tests for validation utils implemented. Test runner updated with watch and coverage. Component, integration, and E2E tests pending.

## 2. Performance Optimizations

- **Worker Enhancements**: The generation worker uses optimized Canvas API with chunking and ImageBitmap for all collections. Enhance progressive rendering previews further.
- **Image Handling**: Pre-compress uploads with Canvas API to reduce ArrayBuffer sizes. Use Web Workers for image resizing during upload to avoid UI blocking.
- **Lazy Loading**: In LayerManager and VirtualTraitList, use IntersectionObserver for lazy-loading trait previews. Optimize re-renders in stores with fine-grained runes updates.
- **Bundle Analysis**: Integrate rollup-plugin-visualizer more actively; run it in CI to monitor bundle size growth.

## 3. Security Improvements

[DONE] **Image Validation**: Added server-side-like validation in browser: check file types strictly (only PNG/JPG), limit file sizes (<10MB per trait), and scan for malicious content using Canvas taint checks before processing.
[DONE] **CSP Refinements**: Added 'worker-src 'self'' explicitly to CSP header in hooks/server.ts.
[DONE] **Data Sanitization**: Implemented XSS prevention with HTML escaping for all user inputs in persistence layer. Enhanced ZIP import validation to prevent path traversal attacks.
[DONE] **Secrets Management**: Verified no hardcoded keys exist; ready for environment variables in future API integrations.

## 4. Documentation and Developer Experience

[DONE] **Expand Docs**: Updated docs/ with user guides (how to add traits, generate collections) and API docs for stores/domain. JSDoc consistency implemented for all public functions.
[DONE] **Code Comments**: Enhanced comments for complex worker logic (chunking algorithm). Created CONTRIBUTING.md with setup instructions.
[DONE] **Changelog**: Added CHANGELOG.md tracking versions from 0.2.1.
[DONE] **Onboarding**: Enhanced docs/onboarding.md with screenshots placeholder for UI flow.

> **Note**: Documentation now accurately reflects actual codebase capabilities. Key discrepancies resolved:
>
> - Generation modal only supports collection size configuration (no advanced settings)
> - Canvas-based processing is optimized for all collections
> - Only ZIP export is currently implemented
> - Performance settings are automatic, not user-configurable

## 5. Code Quality and Best Practices

- **Refactoring**: Domain validation is duplicated between utils/validation.ts and domain/project.service.ts; consolidate into a single validation module. Use Zod for schema validation of Project/Layer/Trait types.
- **Type Safety**: Add more discriminated unions for worker messages. Use branded types for IDs (e.g., ProjectId) to prevent mixing.
- **Error Handling**: Utils/error-handler.ts is good; propagate more typed errors (e.g., ValidationError, StorageError) and add global ErrorBoundary coverage.
- **Accessibility**: Ensure all UI components (buttons, modals) have proper ARIA labels, keyboard navigation, and screen reader support. Test with axe-core.
- **Svelte 5 Migration**: Fully leverage runes; deprecate legacy stores (projectStore, etc.) in favor of runes exports.
- **Build Optimizations**: Add vite-plugin-pwa for offline support (cache static assets). Use adapter-static for full static export.

## 6. Feature Enhancements

- **Export Options**: Beyond ZIP, add direct JSON export for metadata, batch PNG export, or integration with IPFS/Pinata for decentralized storage.
- **UI/UX**: Add drag-and-drop for trait reordering within layers. Implement undo/redo stack for project changes using a history store.
- **Advanced Generation**: Support rarity previews (simulate distributions), background removal for traits, or AI-assisted trait suggestions if integrating ML.
- **Analytics**: Add optional telemetry for generation times/memory usage to improve worker heuristics.

These suggestions aim to make the app more robust, performant, and maintainable while preserving its lightweight nature.
