# NFT Studio - TODO List

## üöÄ High Priority Improvements

### Core Functionality

- [x] **Complete Svelte 5 Migration:** The project has started migrating to Svelte 5, but the transition is not yet complete. Prioritize finishing this migration to leverage the full benefits of runes, which will improve performance and simplify state management.
- [x] **Refactor `Preview.svelte`:** The existence of `Preview.svelte.backup` suggests that a refactoring effort is underway. Complete this refactoring to use Svelte 5 runes (`$derived`, `$effect`) for a more reactive and efficient preview component.
- [x] **Finalize State Management with Runes:** While `runes-store.ts` is a good start, ensure that all state management throughout the application is migrated to Svelte 5 runes for consistency and performance.

### Performance Optimizations

- [x] **Optimize Image Caching and Loading:** Review the image caching mechanism in the `Preview.svelte` component and the `image-loader.worker.ts` to identify opportunities for further optimization.
- [x] **Analyze Bundle Size:** Use `rollup-plugin-visualizer` to analyze the production bundle size and identify any large or unnecessary dependencies that can be removed or optimized.

## üîß Technical Improvements

### Architecture

- [ ] **Improve Postinstall Script:** The current `postinstall` script copies files from `node_modules`, which is not ideal. Investigate alternative solutions, such as using a custom package or a more robust asset pipeline, to handle worker files more elegantly.
- [ ] **Refine Error Handling and Validation:** While the project has a good error handling and validation system, a comprehensive review can help identify any gaps and ensure that all user inputs and data interactions are handled gracefully.

### Data Management

- [ ] **Enhance Local Storage Persistence:** The `runes-store.ts` already includes local storage persistence, but it can be improved by adding more robust error handling and data migration strategies for future updates.

### Worker Improvements

- [ ] **Optimize Worker Communication:** Review the communication between the main thread and the web workers to ensure that data is passed efficiently and that the workers are not causing any performance bottlenecks.

## üìÅ Project Organization

### File Structure

- [ ] **Remove Backup Files:** Once the refactoring of `Preview.svelte` is complete, remove the `Preview.svelte.backup` file to keep the codebase clean and organized.
- [ ] **Review Folder Structure:** Conduct a review of the project's folder structure to identify any opportunities for improvement and ensure that it remains scalable and maintainable.

### Documentation

- [ ] **Update Documentation for Svelte 5:** Update all relevant documentation, including the `onboarding.md` and in-code comments, to reflect the changes introduced by the Svelte 5 migration.
- [ ] **Expand Component Documentation:** Add detailed documentation for each component, including its props, events, and usage examples, to make it easier for new developers to get up to speed.

## üõ°Ô∏è Security & Validation

- [ ] **Implement Content Security Policy (CSP):** Enhance the existing security headers by implementing a strict Content Security Policy (CSP). This will provide an additional layer of protection against XSS and other injection attacks.
- [ ] **Audit Dependencies for Vulnerabilities:** Regularly audit all project dependencies for known vulnerabilities using tools like `pnpm audit` or `snyk`. This will help ensure that the application is not exposed to security risks from third-party packages.
- [ ] **Sanitize User Inputs:** While the project already has some validation in place, a thorough review of all user inputs is needed to ensure that they are properly sanitized to prevent XSS and other injection attacks.

## üß™ Testing

- [ ] **Expand Test Coverage:** The current testing setup is minimal. Expand the test suite to include unit tests for all critical components and services, as well as integration tests for key user flows.
- [ ] **Implement End-to-End (E2E) Testing:** Introduce an E2E testing framework like Playwright or Cypress to automate testing of the application from the user's perspective. This will help ensure that the application is working as expected in a real-world environment.

## üåê Accessibility (a11y)

- [ ] **Conduct Accessibility Audit:** Perform a comprehensive accessibility audit of the application to identify and address any issues that may prevent users with disabilities from accessing the application.
- [ ] **Ensure Keyboard Navigation:** Ensure that all interactive elements in the application can be accessed and operated using only the keyboard. This is a critical requirement for users who cannot use a mouse.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Dependencies & Config Issues

- [ ] **Audit Dependencies:** Perform a thorough audit of all project dependencies to identify and remove any that are outdated, unused, or redundant.
- [ ] **Review Configuration Files:** Review all configuration files, including `package.json`, `svelte.config.js`, `vite.config.ts`, and `tsconfig.json`, to ensure that they are up-to-date and optimized for the project's needs.

## üöÄ Deployment & Build

- [ ] **Optimize CI/CD Pipeline:** Review the existing GitHub Actions workflows to identify opportunities for optimization. This may include caching dependencies more effectively, running jobs in parallel, or using more efficient build commands.
- [ ] **Implement Staging Environment:** Introduce a staging environment that mirrors the production environment. This will allow for thorough testing of all changes before they are deployed to production, reducing the risk of introducing bugs or other issues.
